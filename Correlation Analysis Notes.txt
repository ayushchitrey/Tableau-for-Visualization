Correlation Analysis - Scatter Plots

What will be the Output given the Input?       y = f(x)
What will be the Profit given the Sales?
What will be the Weight Gained given the Calories Consumed?
What will be the Power Output given the Wind Speed?

1) Direction - Positive, Negative, No Relation, Curvilinear
2) Strength - Strong, Moderate, Weak

Prediction - Trend Line

What will be the Power Output given the Wind Speed?

y= mx + c
m slope
c y-intercept

Power Output (MW) = 2.24418 * Wind Speed (m/s) + -6.45 = 
2.24418 * 100m/s +  -6.45 = approx 218MW


p-value - significance of the model.
p-value <= 0.05 - Model is significant

R-Squared Value (COefficient of determination)- strenght

> 0.8 - Strong
0.65 to 0.8 - Moderate
< 0.65 - Weak

High R-Squared Value, Low p-value

Partitioning - Granularity of the data
Addressing - Direction in which the calculation works


Dimensions used to build the graph, will decide the granularity/level of detail at which the computations happen. 


Fixed LOD - Specified Dimensions
	1) Table Scoped Fixed LOD - entire data in the table
	2) Dimension Scoped Fixed LOD
